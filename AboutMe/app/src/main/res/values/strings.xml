    <string name="bio">Hi, I\'m Roy
        \n\n I\'m a software engineer learning how to build Android apps with Kotlin.
        \n\n It\'s been an interesting journey to get this far as an engineer!
        \n\n I\'ve also enjoyed yoga and weight training to keep fit. You should have seen my best handstands!
        \n\n Nowadays with COVID19 I mostly play WoW with online friends. We\'re on the verge of beating
        the final boss on the toughest difficulty!
        \n\n It\s been a much better experience as a gamer since finding this group of LGBT players.
        \n\n Lately my interests have steered toward more spiritual ponderings.
        \n\n Reading some daily Lao Tzu from the <u>Tao Te Ching</u>. The title is actually
        pronounced the <i>Dao De Jing</i> and I didn\'t know!
        \n\n I\'ve also started reading <u>The Souls of Black Folk</u> by W. E. B. Du Bois. It seemed
        out of place with the rest of the spiritual content I\'m consuming. Yet I was pleasantly
        surprised to find the first chapter titled <i>Of Our Spiritual Strivings</i>.
        \n\n My next undertaking is rather daunting: Hegel\'s <u>Phenomenology of Spirit</u>. I\'ll be
        reading it with companion text <u>The Logic of Desire</u>.
        \n\n I\'ve been meaning to tackle Hegel for years, and it struck me that in this new segment of
        my life, approaching spiritual topics, it\'d be as pivotal as it ever could be.
        \n\n And that\'s a little bit about me today! \n
